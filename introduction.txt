Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Eden Sura, and I am a recent Economics graduate with a deep interest in development, agriculture, and solving problems at the community level. I am currently part of the ALX program, where I am gaining practical skills in research, venture creation, and project planning. My academic background has strengthened my analytical thinking and equipped me to apply economic principles to real-world challenges.

I am particularly passionate about agriculture and food security in Ethiopia. Through my current project, I am exploring practical, locally relevant solutions to reduce crop losses in wheat production. I believe in learning through hands-on research, collaborating with stakeholders, and structured planning to create sustainable impact that benefits farmers and strengthens the broader economy.
