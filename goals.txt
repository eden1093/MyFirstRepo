My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year

Over the next year (2026), I really want to get solid with software engineering and tech skills while still building on my Economics and development background.

Finish the ALX Software Engineering program strong — really get comfortable with things like Git/GitHub, programming basics, and building actual projects.
Pick up Python, JavaScript, and some data analysis tools so I can combine them with the analytical skills I already have from Economics.
Get involved in open-source projects or team up with others on challenges, especially anything related to food security, agriculture, or sustainable development.
Keep digging into ways to use tech and research to help reduce crop losses and support farmers in Ethiopia — that’s something I care about a lot.
Stay consistent with learning: practice every day on platforms like GitHub, LeetCode, or freeCodeCamp, and track my progress along the way.
